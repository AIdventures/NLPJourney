# Main NLP Taks

Here you can find at each subfolder a specific NLP task with some projects and examples.
Each section can be taken independently and usually will show you how to train or use a model with the Hugging Face `Trainer API` or with your own training loop, using Hugging Face Accelerate,for example. Feel free to skip either part and focus on the one that interests you the most: the Trainer API is great for fine-tuning or training your model without worrying about what’s going on behind the scenes, while the training loop with Accelerate will let you customize any part you want more easily.

- [Token Classification](token_classification/README.md): Token classification is a generic task that encompasses any problem that can be formulated as “attributing a label to each token in a sentence.”
- [Semantic Search](semantic_search/README.md): Semantic search is a search technique that takes the meaning of words into account rather than just the presence of the words themselves. This is done by embedding the words into a high-dimensional space where the distance between the vectors is a measure of the semantic similarity between the words.
