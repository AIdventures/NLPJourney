# Main NLP Taks

## Semantic Search

Semantic search aims to improve search accuracy by understanding the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning of terms. The advantages are:

- Better handling of synonyms and context.
- Improved search relevance.
- Ability to find related concepts, not just exact matches.

### Key Techniques

- **Word Embeddings**: e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe.
- **Sentence Embeddings**: e.g., BERT, USE (Universal Sentence Encoder).
- **Dense Retrieval**: Using neural networks for matching queries and documents.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search**:
  - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
  - Annoy (Spotify).
  - HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World).

### Common Tasks

- Document retrieval: Finding relevant documents based on a query
- Question answering: Providing answers to questions based on a document corpus.
- Information extraction: Extracting structured information from unstructured text.
- Text classification: Assigning categories or labels to text data.
- Clustering: Grouping similar documents together.
- Chatbots: Conversational agents that can understand and respond to user queries.

### Example Projects

- Building a semantic search engine for a large document corpus.
- Implementing a chatbot with improved query understanding.
- Creating a recommendation system based on content similarity.
